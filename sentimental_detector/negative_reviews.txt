Food was quite expensive.

My kitchens exhaust stopped the house from smelling like smoke

The food today was subpar
Subpar
was disappointed with the steak I ordered. It was tough and lacked seasoning.
The sushi I had was not fresh at all. I could taste that the fish was old, and it left me feeling uneasy.
The eggs Benedict I ordered were a letdown. The hollandaise sauce was curdled, and the eggs were overcooked.
The homemade ice cream here was a huge disappointment. It had an icy texture and lacked the creaminess I was hoping for.
The tasting menu I tried was a major letdown. The dishes were uninspired and lacked creativity.
I ordered a vegetarian dish, but it was incredibly bland. I expected more flavor and variety in the ingredients.
The pizza I had was underwhelming. The crust was soggy, and the toppings were sparse.
The staff seemed disinterested in providing good service. They were slow to take our orders, and the overall experience was frustrating.
The dessert menu was a letdown. The chocolate cake I ordered was dry and tasted like it had been sitting out for too long.
the pizza was bland
I hate it here
You know what really grinds my gears? Everything! Our world has become a swirling vortex of chaos and frustration, and it's time to let loose on all the things that drive us crazy.
